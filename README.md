A discord bot with several dumb games and commands.

Being a weeblord, the main goal of developing this bot was to include anime-related commands. Therefore, the next step planned is to consume [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/)'s public [API](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1804432) when its development is completed and make some simple games with it. [Invite him to your server!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=614361547162255381&permissions=397284599872&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

*Note that running this bot will download approximately 100MB of NLTK data into your home directory as* ```nltk_data```
